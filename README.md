# myapp - testing Riverpod provider

a flutter project with riverpod provider

## Getting started with Riverpod

This project is a playground for Riverpod. It is not a design masterpiece, but it works :)

Current version use global variables to pass values between screens.

I'm trying to solve why using class variables throws Flutter framework error:

>'package:flutter/src/widgets/framework.dart': Failed assertion: line 4692 pos 14: 'owner!._debugCurrentBuildTarget == this': is not true.
